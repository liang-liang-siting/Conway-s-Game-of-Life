While working on this app, one challenge we faced was structuring the game logic to implement Conway's Game of Life effectively. We had to carefully design the grid and cell interactions to ensure proper cell births, deaths, and transitions according to the game rules. Additionally, implementing features like the heatmap mode required devising a mechanism to dynamically change cell colors based on their state and neighbors, which added complexity to the rendering logic.

Given more time, we would introduce additional features such as Longer Lasting Cells. This feature would add a toggle to the game interface, allowing cells to persist for multiple frames before dying, introducing a new dimension to the gameplay. Implementing this feature would require careful consideration of the cell lifecycle and interactions, as cells would need to navigate and survive based on specific conditions within a limited timeframe.

Another feature we would add is Clustered Setup, aiming to enhance the visual appeal and complexity of the game. This feature would introduce an algorithm to cluster cells together in interesting patterns, promoting the emergence of dynamic and visually compelling configurations within the grid. The approach would involve researching clustering algorithms and adapting them to fit the requirements of the game, enhancing the overall experience for players.

While working on this assignment, we made assumptions regarding the familiarity of the audience with Conway's Game of Life and related concepts, such as cell states and transitions. Additionally, we assumed a basic understanding of React and web development principles to implement the app efficiently.

Overall, this assignment took approximately three days to complete, including planning, implementation, testing, and documentation.
